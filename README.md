# Spiral Abyss Party Randomizer

Inspired by [Mosurameso (モスラメソ)](https://www.youtube.com/@mosurameso) [all characters roulette Spiral Abyss streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxn0k-vF3UAPQHVKowc_7XW9dYU5te6Ij), include character that you have/build to randomly group it.

- Each group will have 8 random characters
- Use that 8 characters to form a party for first half and second half of floor
- Record the group's star result
- For the last group, if remaining character exists, it'll fill with random character from the included character list (excluding remaining character)
- If Traveler's element not included, you can freely choose the Traveler's element
- Randomized groups results are auto-saved in your local storage, you can check the result's run in Saved Result tab
